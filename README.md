# Data Structures and Algorithms in C
Welcome to a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in the C programming language. This repository is designed as a learning resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in strengthening their foundational computer science knowledge.

# 📖 About This Repository
The primary goal of this project is to provide clear, efficient, and well-commented code for fundamental DSA concepts. The focus is on readability and understanding, making it easier for beginners to grasp complex topics and for others to refresh their knowledge.

This is an active and evolving repository. I will be continuously adding new implementations and refining existing code to ensure it remains a high-quality and relevant resource.

# 🚀 Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have gcc and git installed. You can check by running:

gcc --version
<br>
git --version

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SANDIPAN-DUTTA/C-language-DSA.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd C-language-DSA

# Compile and Run a File:
Each implementation is self-contained. To compile and run a specific file (e.g., linked_list.c), use the following commands:

# Compile the C file, creating an executable named 'linked_list'
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list

# Run the compiled program
./linked_list

# 💡 What's Inside?
This repository is structured to cover a wide array of essential topics.

Data Structures
Linear: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, Queues

Non-Linear: Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees), Heaps, Hash Tables, Graphs

Algorithms
Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search

Graph Traversal: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)

And more... including dynamic programming and greedy algorithms will be added over time.
